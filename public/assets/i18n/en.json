        "q2": "How quickly can I get an appointment?",
        "a2": "Usually we can offer you an appointment within 1-3 working days. In case of acute emergencies, we are available daily and can usually treat you on the same day.",
        "q3": "Which services are covered by health insurance?",
        "a3": "As a private physician, you will receive a detailed invoice from us that you can submit to your health insurance. Depending on your insurance, typically 50-80% of the standard rates are reimbursed. Private insurance usually covers the full amount.",
        "q4": "Can I come just for an MRI examination?",
        "a4": "Yes, of course. We also offer private MRI examinations without long waiting times. High-resolution imaging is provided in cooperation with Radiology Doringer directly at the Ritzensee Private Clinic.",
        "q5": "What should I bring to my first appointment?",
        "a5": "Please bring your E-Card, any existing findings, X-ray or MRI images, and a list of your current medications. If available, also a referral from your family doctor – but this is not mandatory."
